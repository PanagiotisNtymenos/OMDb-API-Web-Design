# OMDb-API-Web-Design

## About  
This project is a movie search engine, done as an assignment for the AUEB University, using [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).  
The backend is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io) project, running on localhost using Tomcat.  
The Database is a plain local [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) file using SQL Queries.
The site has four functions:  
  * Search Movies  
  * Create Account  
  * Login/Logout  
  * Save/Delete Bookmakrs  

The transactions between the frontend and the backend are achieved using a REST API made by myself!
