# OMDb API Web Page
  
This is a movie search site, utilized as an assignment for the AUEB University. 
With some basic knowlegde of HTML/JavaScript/CSS I created the frontend which is a search bar and a bookmark collection.

  
## About
This project uses the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for getting movies and their information.   
The backend is a JAVA [Spring Boot](https://spring.io) project, running on localhost using Tomcat.  
The Database is a plain local [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) file using SQL Queries to fetch/save data.  
The site has four functions:  
  * Search Movies  
  * Create Account  
  * Login/Logout  
  * Save/Delete Bookmarks  

The transactions between the frontend and the backend are achieved using a REST API I made myself!
