# OMDb API Web Design
  
## About 
This is a movie search site, utilized as an assignment for the AUEB University. 
With some basic knowlegde of HTML/Javascript/CSS I created the frontend which is a search bar and a bookmark collection.
  
## Tech Stuff
This project uses the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for getting movies and their information. 
The backend is a JAVA [Spring Boot](https://spring.io) project, running on localhost using Tomcat.  
The Database is a plain local [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) file using SQL Queries.
The site has four functions:  
  * Search Movies  
  * Create Account  
  * Login/Logout  
  * Save/Delete Bookmakrs  

The transactions between the frontend and the backend are achieved using a REST API made by myself!
